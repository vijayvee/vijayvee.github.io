Hello! I am a 5th year Ph.D. student advised by [Dr. Virginia de Sa](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~desa/) at the [UCSD Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.ucsd.edu) department. **I'm on the industry job market for Research Scientist / Research Engineer roles starting from Jan 2024!!**

Currently active projects: (1) Developing adaptive deep networks with dynamic architectures to process static images. (2) Egocentric video-language pretraining using multimodal LLMs.

In the past, I have done internships at Google Brain, Facebook AI Research and Qualcomm AI Research working on adversarial images, (designing, conducting and analyzing) human perceptual experiments, self-supervised representation and unsupervised video representation learning.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I spent a year working at Brown University with [Dr. Thomas Serre](http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/).
In April 2017, I graduated with a bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [SSN College of Engineering](http://www.ssn.edu.in/?page_id=124), Chennai, India.
